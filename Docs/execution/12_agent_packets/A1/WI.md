# WI_A1

## Goal
Deliver production-safe implementation for core/commands, core/document-history, mutation dispatch integration, integrated with existing architecture and with no duplicate mutation execution path.

## Owned write scope
- core/commands, core/document-history, mutation dispatch integration
- Agent-specific UI/state wiring required for this feature.

## Forbidden write scope
- Backend code and API contracts.
- Unrelated UI refactors outside the owned scope.
- Any direct page/document mutation path bypassing command dispatcher.

## Required deliverables
- Functional feature implementation in owned scope.
- Updated docs under Docs/execution/30_evidence/A1/RESULT.md.
- Regression-safe integration against current ribbon/sidebar/workspace flows.

## Critical code snippets (target shape)
```ts
// core/commands/types.ts
export type CommandSource = 'toolbar' | 'thumbnail-context' | 'macro-runner' | 'shortcut';

export type DocumentCommand =
  | { type: 'rotate-pages'; pages: number[]; degrees: 90 | 180 | 270 }
  | { type: 'remove-pages'; pages: number[] }
  | { type: 'replace-page'; targetPage: number; donorBytes: Uint8Array; donorPage: number };

export interface CommandResult {
  ok: boolean;
  logs: string[];
  nextBytes?: Uint8Array;
  pageCount?: number;
}
```

## Quantitative pass tests (must be measurable)
1. corepack pnpm --filter frontend exec tsc --noEmit exits 0.
2. corepack pnpm --filter frontend lint exits 0.
3. corepack pnpm --filter frontend test exits 0.
4. In files modified by this WI, count(window.prompt() occurrences) = 0.
5. In files modified by this WI, count(direct replaceWorkingCopy() additions outside command/history layer) = 0.
6. During 10-step manual run for this WI, uncaught exceptions count = 0.

## Manual validation matrix (quantitative)
- Browser matrix: Chrome latest + Edge latest.
- Each critical user flow executed 3 consecutive times with failure count = 0.
- Expected-vs-actual checklist completion ratio = 100%.

## Rollback criteria
- Any pass-test command non-zero exit.
- Any reproducible regression in existing workflow.
- Any command-bus bypass introduced by this WI.

## Evidence checklist
- [ ] Git diff summary scoped to WI.
- [ ] Command outputs for all quantitative pass tests.
- [ ] Manual validation table with run counts and pass/fail totals.
- [ ] Defects found/fixed log.
- [ ] Residual risk statement.
